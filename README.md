# What

Spreadsheets for terminal written in C Languadge.

# Why

I am/was learning C by reading K&R book, and needed a big enough
program to test my knowledge. So I choose to write a spreadsheets
editor. Such an odd choice, mostly, because at the time I've just
watched "Rethinking reactivity" talk by Rich Harris.
